🧠 Prompt for Replit: Fraudulent Transaction Detection for Credit Cards
🎯 Objective:
Develop a Python-based web application that allows users (e.g., analysts or banking staff) to upload transaction data or simulate transactions. The app will use machine learning to detect potentially fraudulent credit card transactions based on patterns, anomalies, and historical data.

🛠️ Technologies to Use:
Python
Flask or Streamlit (for UI)
scikit-learn, XGBoost, or LightGBM (for ML model)
Pandas and NumPy (for data handling)
Matplotlib or Plotly (for visualizations)
Replit file upload support (for CSV input)

📋 Features:
Transaction Data Upload: Users upload CSV files containing transaction records.
Data Preprocessing: Clean and normalize data (e.g., time, amount, location).
Feature Engineering: Extract features like transaction frequency, amount deviation, merchant category, etc.
ML-Based Fraud Detection: Use a trained classification model to flag suspicious transactions.
Result Display: Show flagged transactions with fraud probability scores.
Visualization Dashboard (optional): Display fraud trends, heatmaps, and summaries.

"""
Fraudulent Transaction Detection for Credit Cards

Build a Python web application that:
1. Allows users to upload credit card transaction data (CSV format).
2. Preprocesses the data to extract relevant features (e.g., amount, time, location).
3. Uses a trained ML classification model to detect potentially fraudulent transactions.
4. Displays flagged transactions with fraud probability scores.
5. Optionally provides visualizations of fraud patterns and summaries.

Requirements:
- Use Flask or Streamlit for the web interface.
- Integrate file upload and preview functionality.
- Use scikit-learn, XGBoost, or LightGBM for model training and prediction.
- Include sample data and model for demonstration.
- Ensure the app runs smoothly on Replit with interactive UI.

🧪 Sample Features for Detection:
Transaction amount vs. user’s average
Time of transaction (e.g., odd hours)
Location mismatch (e.g., sudden country change)
Merchant category anomalies
Frequency of transactions in short time

📦 Bonus Suggestions:
Add real-time simulation of transactions.
Include user profile modeling for personalized fraud detection.
Use unsupervised learning (e.g., Isolation Forest) for anomaly detection.
Provide downloadable fraud reports.
